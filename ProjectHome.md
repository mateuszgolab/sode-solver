Development of web-based application using  Java, Google Web Toolkit and Google App Engine for solving series of simultaneous ordinary differential equations (linear or non-linear) modelling physical systems that evolve over time .  The project is to devise a 2D graphical application that allows the user to define the equations and to implement the solution with an adaptive approach to the time-stepping. The results of the integration should be displayed dynamically, with appropriate user choices over which variables are displayed. The application should also provide possibility of storing and retrieving  solution parameters and equations entered by the User.
